# PWA (Progressive Web App) Setup

Your Travel App has been converted to a PWA with the following features:

## 📋 What's Included

### 1. **Service Worker**
- Automatic caching of assets for offline access
- Network-first strategy for Supabase API calls
- Cache expiration policies to keep data fresh

### 2. **Web App Manifest** (`public/manifest.json`)
- App name, description, and icons
- Theme colors for the app
- Standalone display mode (looks like a native app)
- Support for both portrait and landscape orientations

### 3. **Installation Support**
- Can be installed on mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- Desktop installation via Chrome/Edge
- Apple-specific meta tags for iOS compatibility

### 4. **Offline Support**
- Static assets are cached for offline use
- Supabase API calls have smart caching (5-minute cache)
- Service worker handles network failures gracefully

## 🚀 How to Use

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The PWA is fully functional after build. The service worker will be automatically generated by Vite PWA plugin.

## 📱 Installation

### Mobile Installation
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Look for the "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" prompt

- `public/icon-512x512.svg` (512x512px)

Preferred formats:
- PNG or SVG
- Square aspect ratio
- Support for transparency
